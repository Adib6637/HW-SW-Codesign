\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Resource sharing}
Resource sharing is the assignment of a resource to more than one operation. The 
primary goal of resource sharing is to reduce the area of a circuit, by allowing multiple 
non-concurrent operations to share the same hardware operator. Resource sharing is 
often mandatory to meet specified upper bounds on the circuit area (or resource usage)\cite{b1}.

\subsection{Resource binding}
Resource binding is the explicit definition of a mapping between the operations 
and the resources. A binding may imply that some resources are shared. Resource 
binding (or partial binding) may be part of the original circuit specifications, and 
thus some sharing may be defined explicitly in the hardware model. Resource usage 
constraints may infer implicitly some resource sharing, even though they do not imply 
a particular binding\cite{b1}.
