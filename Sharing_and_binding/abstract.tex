High level synthesis or known as architectural synthesis is a stage in hardware modeling where logic level specification is produce from circuit behavior model. Architectural synthesis consist of two stage. First, placing the operation in time and place. Second, determining the detailed interconnection of data path and the logic level. The main objective for the first stage is to find the appropriate correct number and type of resource sharing so that design constraint is fulfilled which have been done as specification for architectural synthesis. This process involve some problem related to resources sharing and binding due to the specification. In this research paper we will discuss topic related to resource sharing and binding problem for general circuit and how we approach to solve them. To make it easy to understand, this paper also include some basic concept and important terms that are dominant in this paper.
